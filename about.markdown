I am a researcher passionate about transforming automotive sensor data into a rich digital environment
to enhance autonomous vehicle perception. My work primarily involves maintaining and improving the perception
stack of autonomous vehicle platforms. I have experience integrating and processing data from cameras, automotive radars,
and LiDAR sensors, with a strong interest in sensor fusion.
