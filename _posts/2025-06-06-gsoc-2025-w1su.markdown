## Week 1 progress

This week, I began exploring the `video-play.c` script, where I needed to adapt the code to retrieve the correct 
format from my host machine's camera. The format provided by the camera was YUY2, so I primarily identified two areas in 
the code that needed modification to support this format: 
1. Add support for the YUY2 format in `on_stream_param_changed` in text creation and format changes.
2. Include the YUY2 format in the format enumeration in `build_format` function.

Although I started to make the necessary code modifications, they were not really tested. During AGL GSoC weekly call,
it was pointed out that the support for the camera format is already implemented as `camera_pipewire` 
of [ivi-homescreen-plugins][1]. 


## Next steps
1. Build the [ivi-homescreen][2] along with `camera_pipewire` plugin.
2. Run and explore the [camera/camera_linux][3] example from [tcna-packages][4] repository.
