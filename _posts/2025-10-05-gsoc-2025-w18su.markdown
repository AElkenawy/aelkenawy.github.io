## Week 18 progress

During the past week, I began exploring TensorFlow and setting up the environment for TensorFlow Lite by 
following the steps in the [karthickai/tflite][1] repository. I am building TensorFlow version 
2.19.0 in order to match the version used in the Yocto master branch listed in the [OpenEmbedded Layer Index][2]. 

### abseil-cpp library linking issues

While building the tensorflow library shared library (.so), I encountered an issue where the Abseil (absl) library was 
not found when running:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ldd libtensorflow-lite.so
{% endhighlight %}

I found out that the absl library needs to be added as a `sub_directory`, then explicitly linked using `target_link_libraries` 
to my executable in the CMakeLists.txt. My mentor suggested following the [abseil-cpp build instructions][3], starting 
by adding the `abseil-cpp` as a Git submodule in my project.

## Next steps

1. Complete the TensorFlow setup 
2. Integrate the TensorFlow pipeline with the current Camera PipeWire application
