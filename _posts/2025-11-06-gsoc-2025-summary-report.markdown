# Intelligent Camera Stream Integration and Warning System (ICSW)


The Project Summary provides an overview about Intelligent Camera Stream Integration and Warning System (ICSW) project,
which was part of the [Google Summer of Code][1] (GSoC) 2025 program The **ICSW** project was mentored by [The Linux Foundation][2]
through its [Automotive Grade Linux (AGL)][3] open source initiative. 
The purpose of the **ICSW** project was to develop a modular system that servers as a warning system for automotive application. 

As part of this work, the project focused on:

1. Researching and benchmarking the capabilities of different hardware backends for automotive applications
2. Detecting and classifying environmental objects that directly affects the driving behavior in real time
3. Visualizing relevant detected objects and conveying appropriate warning messages.


The progress achieved so far lays the foundations for the planned **ICSW** system. The work completed during the Google 
Summer of Code 2025 program managed to address the following components of the system:
1. **Inference models** for detecting surrounding objects and traffic signs
2. **Flutter Application** for visual demonstration of retrieved and processed camera streams
3. **PipeWire Multimedia Layer** for managing and controlling the flow of camera streams
4. **gRPC Communication Layer** for intercommunication between system components, and for activating or switching detection modes
