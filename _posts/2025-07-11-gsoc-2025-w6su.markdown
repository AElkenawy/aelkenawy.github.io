## Week 6 progress

This week, I had the opportunity to attend the [All Member Meeting][1] (AMM) of [Automotive Grade Linux (AGL)][2], held in Berlin. The event featured 
numerous presentations covering a variety of topics including Software-Defined Vehicles, virtualization, vehicle 
communication, safety compliance, and much more.

### Personal Interest
The meeting provided valuable insights into current trends within the open-source automotive ecosystem. It was also 
highly relevant to my GSoC project, as I had the chance to meet my mentors in person, [Jan-Simon](mailto:jsmoeller@linuxfoundation.org), 
[Walt](mailto:wminer@linuxfoundation.org), and [George](mailto:george.kiagiadakis@collabora.com).

#### PipeWire: State of the Union
I had the privilege of attending [George](mailto:george.kiagiadakis@collabora.com)'s session on the latest developments
in the low-level multimedia library, PipeWire. He discussed several new features such as multithreaded execution on the 
server side, lazy scheduling, an FFmpeg video converter, and more. While many of these features might not be directly 
applicable to my current project, it is always beneficial to learn about the tools available within the library.

#### Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs)
I had an idea about the buzzword of SDV but had not realized how developed and complex the topic is. Many sessions 
such as "Accelerating SDV Through Virtualization," "How to Design SDV," and "Advancing the Virtual Vehicle Fleet", 
greatly expanded my understanding. I also learned about the emerging Eclipse OpenSOVD community, which was especially interesting.

### Stack of Open-Source Ecosystem
I was introduced to several open-source stacks that can be used to build a comprehensive ecosystem for vehicles, 
especially those that are connected or have autonomous capabilities. Based on what I learned, I combined several of 
these stacks into a single system (without adding AGL), illustrated in the following diagram:

## Next Steps
1. Learn more about the available automotive open-source tools.
2. Adapt relevant open-source technologies in my GSoC project, if time allows.
