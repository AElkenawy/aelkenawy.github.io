## Week 12 progress

This week I started integrating the CI jobs for the environment used by the [inference model][1].

### cam_infer_models CI Job

I wrote the first CI job to build the environment, including the OpenCV with OpenVINO support and the gRPC
library for the server-client communication. I will add two more CI jobs of clang-tidy and clang-format. I used 
the workflow from the ivi-homescreen repository as a reference and tested the workflow locally in a Docker container
using `act`:

{% highlight bash %}
act workflow_dispatch -j infer_models
{% endhighlight %}

As a second test, I ran the workflow on GitHub Actions. During that run I removed `ubuntu-24.04` from the OS matrix in 
`cam-infer-models.yaml` as GitHub Actions does not provide an `ubuntu-24.04` runner.


## Next steps

1. Fix cmake issues of [inference model][1].
2. Add CI jobs for clang-tidy and clang-format
3. Improving the current inference models and automate dataset generation.
